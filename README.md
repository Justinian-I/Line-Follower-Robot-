# Line-Follower-Robot-

Our project is about a line tracking robot and obstacle avoiding 
robot which is  equipped with sensors mounted on a four-wheeled 
platform. While the left and right IR sensors detect where the robot is 
on the line, the ultra sonic will continusley send ultra sonic waves to 
detect if there is an obstacle infront of it or not , the servo motor will 
help the ultra sonic to move 0 degree to 180 degree to take a decision 
to take a right or left line to take the side where there is no obstacle,  
the L298N driver is connected to 4 wheels  which ensures precise 
control over the four-wheel motors with the help of the batteries it 
help to move the 4 wheels forward . 
The main purpose of line-following robots is to achieve a 
specific goal or task by moving on a specific line or path. Some of the 
general purposes of line following robots are: 
• Educational Projects: Line-following robots are often used in 
educational projects. Students and hobbyists can choose such 
projects to improve their robotics and programming skills. 
• Industrial automation: In the field of industrial automation, 
line-following robots can be used to move materials or perform 
certain tasks on production lines. 
• Entertainment and Competitions: Line-following robots can 
be used in robot competitions or recreational events. 
Competitors can try to get their robot to the finish line as quickly 
as possible by following the line on a specific race track. 
• Magazine and Exhibition Shows: Line-following robots can be 
used for demonstration purposes in store windows or at science 
and technology exhibitions. These types of robots can be used to 
engage visitors and promote technology. 
• Home Automation and Service Robots: Line follower robots 
can be used as home automation or service robots. For example, 
a line-following robot can perform certain tasks around the home 
by traveling along a certain line, such as cleaning the house or 
carrying small objects. 
• Education and Awareness: Line follower robots can be used 
for education and awareness raising on robotic technologies and 
automation. These robots can be used to provide information on 
these topics to students, teachers, and the general public.
